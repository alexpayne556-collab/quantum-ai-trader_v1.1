**Title: Built 200+ trading modules but completely stuck - need breakthrough advice**

**Post Content:**

I've been building trading systems for 2 years and I'm completely paralyzed by analysis paralysis. Here's my situation:

**What I Have:**
- 200+ Python trading modules (backtesting, scanners, dashboards, AI systems)
- $500 capital ready to trade live
- Willingness to work 12-16 hours/day
- Some modules show 70-80% win rates in backtesting

**My Problems:**
1. **Too many modules** - I have 200+ modules but don't know which ones to focus on
2. **No integration** - Each module works individually but they don't work together as a system
3. **Analysis paralysis** - I spend all my time organizing and perfecting instead of executing
4. **No clear path** - I can't get from "200 modules" to "working trading system"
5. **Working alone** - Just me and one AI assistant trying to solve this massive complexity

**The Bottleneck:**
I'm working 12-16 hours/day but making zero progress. Every day I reorganize modules, write documentation, plan architecture - but I never actually TRADE or build community.

**What I've Tried:**
- Building more modules (just makes it worse)
- Perfecting architecture (never ends)
- Applying to quant firms (rejected - no documented performance)
- GitHub repos (get stars but no real help)

**My Questions:**
1. **Has anyone been through this exact situation?** 200+ modules, completely stuck?
2. **How did you break through the bottleneck?** What was the specific turning point?
3. **Which modules should I focus on?** How do you prioritize when you have too much?
4. **How do you go from "lots of code" to "working system"?**
5. **Should I keep building or start executing with what I have?**

**What I'm Willing to Do:**
- Share my modules if helpful
- Document my journey publicly
- Collaborate with others
- Start trading live with $500
- Listen to advice and implement it

**My GitHub:** [I'll share link if people are interested]

**The Hard Truth:**
I feel like I'm sitting on a goldmine of code but it's completely useless because it's not integrated and I'm working in isolation. I need real advice from people who've been through this, not theoretical suggestions.

**Has anyone actually broken through this bottleneck? What was your specific strategy?**
