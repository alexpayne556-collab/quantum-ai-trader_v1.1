## 🎯 **PHASE 2: SYNTHESIS & ORGANIZATION**

### **After Perplexity Responses - Intelligence Processing:**

#### **Step 1: Pattern Classification Matrix**
```
Create comprehensive matrix of all detection methods:

PATTERN TYPE | ACCURACY | COMPLEXITY | DATA REQ | PROFIT POTENTIAL | IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

Examples:
- Explosive Move Detection | 78% | High | Real-time + Options | 200%+ | PRIORITY 1
- Short-Term Gains | 65% | Medium | Real-time + Volume | 5-10% | PRIORITY 2
- Reversal Signals | 72% | High | Multi-timeframe | 15-30% | PRIORITY 1
- Momentum Breakouts | 61% | Low | Real-time | 10-25% | PRIORITY 3
- Mean Reversion | 68% | Medium | Technical + Sentiment | 5-15% | PRIORITY 2
```

#### **Step 2: Data Source Hierarchy**
```
Rank all data sources by edge vs cost:

DATA SOURCE | COST | EDGE | RELIABILITY | IMPLEMENTATION | PRIORITY

Examples:
- Real-time OHLCV (Polygon) | $200/mo | High | 99.9% | Easy | MUST HAVE
- Options Flow (Unusual Whales) | $100/mo | Very High | 95% | Medium | HIGH VALUE
- News Sentiment (FinBERT) | Free | Medium | 98% | Hard | NICE TO HAVE
- Insider Trading (SEC) | Free | High | 100% | Medium | HIGH VALUE
- Social Media (Reddit/Twitter) | Free | Medium | 90% | Hard | Niche
```

#### **Step 3: Architecture Decision Framework**
```
Choose optimal architecture based on intelligence:
