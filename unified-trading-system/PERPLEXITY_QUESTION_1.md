# 🤖 Perplexity Question 1 - Community & Funding Strategy

## 🎯 **THE EXACT QUESTION TO ASK PERPLEXITY**

### **Copy and Paste This Into Perplexity:**

---

I have 200+ trading system modules built but they're isolated. Each solves one problem but they're not integrated. How do I:

1. **Package these into a GitHub repo** so others can see what's built
2. **Structure them so collaborators can contribute WITHOUT breaking things**
3. **Create a clear 'help needed' roadmap** that attracts developers
4. **Build community momentum around incomplete code** (not just finished products)
5. **Get feedback from traders + developers simultaneously**
6. **Create pull request system** that doesn't require I review everything
7. **Scale from me-building to community-building**

**Give specific:**
- GitHub repo structure
- Contribution guidelines
- Community Discord/forum setup
- How to attract the RIGHT collaborators (not random people)
