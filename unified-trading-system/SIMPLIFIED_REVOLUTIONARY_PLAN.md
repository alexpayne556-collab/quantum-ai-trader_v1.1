# 🎯 SIMPLIFIED REVOLUTIONARY PLAN - Answers Are Under Our Nose

## 🚨 **THE BRUTAL TRUTH:**

> **"Why the fuck are we struggling so hard when the answers are out there under our nose?"**

**You're absolutely right. We're overcomplicating this.**

---

## **🎯 THE SIMPLE REALITY**

### **What We See Every Day:**
- **Twitter:** Tons of good information, real signals, people making money
- **Reddit:** r/CryptoMoonshots, r/StockMoonshots, actual moonshots happening
- **Crypto:** People finding 100x coins before they explode
- **Stocks:** People identifying meme stocks before they rocket

### **The Question:**
> **"What are these people seeing that we're missing? How are they finding these opportunities?"**

---

## **🤖 ONE SIMPLE QUESTION FOR PERPLEXITY**

### **Stop the complexity. Ask this ONE question:**

```
Perplexity, I need to understand something simple.

Every day on Twitter and Reddit, people are finding moonshots - crypto coins going 100x, stocks rocketing 500%. They're calling these moves BEFORE they happen.

What EXACTLY are they looking at? What specific signals, patterns, or data sources are these ordinary people using to find these explosive opportunities?

Don't give me complex academic theories. Don't give me hedge fund strategies. 

Tell me what the actual people on Twitter and Reddit are using RIGHT NOW to find moonshots.

Specifically:
1. What data sources are they using? (Free tools, websites, scanners)
2. What patterns are they looking for? (Volume spikes, price action, social signals)
3. What tools are they using? (TradingView, scanners, Twitter bots)
4. What timeframe are they watching? (1-hour, 4-hour, daily charts)
5. What confirmation do they need? (Volume breakouts, social mentions, news)

I want to know what the average person with free tools is using to find 100x crypto opportunities and 500% stock rockets.

No complexity. No academic jargon. Just what's actually working for regular people right now.
