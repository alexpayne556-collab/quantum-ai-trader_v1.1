## 🎯 **PERPLEXITY ENGAGEMENT PLAN**

### **Prompt 1: Repository Analysis**
> "I've built a production-grade AI trading system with FastAPI + React. It features multi-factor quant scoring, Bayesian signal fusion, institutional backtesting, and real-time WebSocket streaming. I have a clean repository with elite trading modules and advanced dashboard components. Can you analyze the architecture and suggest optimizations for scalability and GitHub launch success?"

### **Prompt 2: Feature Prioritization**  
> "My AI trading system has these advanced components available: 6 specialized scanners (pre-gainer, dark pool, insider trading), ensemble ranking engine, regime detection, Kelly position sizing, and 41 dashboard variants. I need help prioritizing which features to implement first for maximum GitHub traction and real-world value. What should be my development roadmap?"

### **Prompt 3: Commercial Strategy**
> "I've created an institutional-grade AI trading platform with professional quant algorithms, multi-source data reliability, and enterprise features. The system performs 14-day forecasts with confidence bands and has a 70-80% target win rate. What are the best commercial pathways for this technology? Should I target quant firms, FinTech companies, or build a SaaS product?"
