# Perplexity Brief: Uncovering Hidden Patterns in Future-Sector Alpha

**Mission**: Ask questions nobody else is asking. Discover what's hidden in plain sight. Turn over every stone to find patterns, signals, and structure in frontier sectors that the market hasn't priced yet.

**Core Philosophy**: We're not following—we're discovering. Train on the past to predict the future, but identify the inflection points, regime shifts, and microstructure tells that only become visible when you ask questions others don't.

## 🔬 DISCOVERY LAYER 1: Hidden Universe Construction

### The Questions Nobody Asks:

**1.1 Supply Chain Lead Indicators**
- Which suppliers/component makers move 2-4 weeks BEFORE the household names in robotaxis, AI infra, quantum? (Example: Does ASML's order book predict NVDA's next move? Does LRCX tool shipments predict AMD momentum?)
- What are the 10-15 "picks and shovels" plays that institutional flow ignores but options flow shows accumulation?
- Which tickers have the highest correlation to CapEx announcements from MSFT/GOOGL/META/AMZN but trade at 1/10th the IV premium?

**1.2 Dark Pool & Unusual Options Flow**
- For robotaxis/AI infra, which names show persistent dark pool buying (block trades >$5M) but haven't broken out yet?
- Which frontier names (IONQ, RGTI, STEM, ENS) show call skew >75th percentile + OI accumulation suggesting insider positioning before catalysts?
- What's the relationship between options OI build (30-60 DTE) and subsequent 2-3 week price moves across quantum/grid-storage names?

**1.3 Sector Rotation Precursors**
- Which 5-8 names act as "canaries" for sector rotation into/out of AI infra, autonomy, quantum? (Do they peak 3-5 days early? Lag and confirm?)
- What combination of breadth (new highs/lows), equal-weight vs cap-weight divergence, and vol term-structure predicts a sector regime flip 5-10 days ahead?
- Which defensive names (utilities, staples) show divergence patterns that mark AI/tech exhaustion before it's obvious?

**1.4 Hidden Correlation Structures**
- Beyond obvious sector peers, what non-intuitive correlations exist? (Example: Does natural gas (UNG) predict grid-storage moves? Does semiconductor equipment predict quantum hardware? Does trucking/logistics predict robotaxi adoption speed?)
- Which cross-asset correlations (bonds, commodities, crypto, VIX) offer 24-48hr lead time on frontier-sector regime shifts?
- What intra-day correlation breakdowns (morning vs afternoon) signal institutional accumulation vs retail chasing?

### What We Want:
1. A 40-60 ticker "alpha discovery" universe: 60% household names (TSLA, NVDA, PLTR), 40% hidden gems (suppliers, enablers, pre-catalyst plays).
2. Liquidity filters: ≥$50M ADV, tight spreads (<0.3%), options depth (≥500 OI at 30 DTE).
3. Monthly refresh rules using: dark pool flow anomalies, options skew shifts, breadth divergence, CapEx correlation analysis.

## 🧠 DISCOVERY LAYER 2: Microstructure & Regime Archaeology

### The Questions Nobody Asks:

**2.1 Pre-Breakout Microstructure**
- What specific order-flow signatures appear 2-4 days before a frontier-sector name breaks out? (Examples: bid-ask spread compression, hidden liquidity probe prints, sequential block trades in dark pools?)
- Do successful breakouts in IONQ, RGTI, STEM show a "footprint" pattern: vol compression → spread tightening → unusual call sweep → gap move?
- What distinguishes real accumulation (institutions slowly building) from pump setups (retail FOMO)? Can we quantify via: average trade size, time-of-day clustering, quote stuffing absence/presence?

**2.2 Multi-Regime Pattern Recognition**
- Instead of bull/bear/sideways, can we define 8-12 micro-regimes by combining:
  - VIX regime (sub-15 / 15-25 / 25-35 / 35+)
  - Sector heat (top decile / cooling / bottoming / dead)
  - Breadth (expanding / contracting / diverging)
  - Vol term-structure (contango / flat / backwardation)
- For each micro-regime, what are the optimal barrier widths, hold periods, and feature weights?
- Which regimes favor momentum continuation vs mean-reversion, and what transitions between them give 24-48hr warning?

**2.3 Anchored VWAP Edge Discovery**
- Post-earnings, post-guidance, post-product-days: how far can price stretch from AVWAP before 70%+ probability of reversion within 3-5 days?
- Do different sectors have different AVWAP "snap-back" behaviors? (AI infra: 2σ before snap? Quantum: 3σ? Robotaxis: 1.5σ?)
- Can we combine AVWAP distance + RSI(7) + options skew to predict intraday vs multi-day reversions?

**2.4 Hidden EMA/Pattern Language**
- Beyond 8/21/55 EMA stacks, what non-standard combinations reveal hidden structure? (Example: 13/34/89 Fibonacci stack, 5/10/20 fast-momentum stack for high-vol names?)
- Do "higher-high, higher-low" patterns have different success rates when accompanied by:
  - Vol expansion vs compression?
  - Call vs put skew shifts?
  - Dark pool flow confirmation vs silence?
- What candlestick/pattern sequences (engulfing, harami, marubozu, doji) actually predict next 5-10 day moves in frontier names, and which are noise?

### What We Want:
1. A 3D regime map: [market regime] × [sector heat] × [vol structure] with specific barrier widths, EMA configs, and AVWAP thresholds per cell.
2. Order-flow signatures (20-30 features) that distinguish real accumulation from noise 2-4 days before moves.
3. Pattern library: which setups work in which regimes for frontier sectors, with historical win-rates and profit factors.

## 🎯 DISCOVERY LAYER 3: Adaptive Horizon & Label Archaeology

### The Questions Nobody Asks:

**3.1 Event-Proximity Horizon Warping**
- How should forecast horizons compress/expand based on:
  - Days to earnings (compress from 10d → 5d as earnings approach)?
  - Proximity to Fed announcements, regulatory decisions, product launches?
  - Sector-specific events (robotaxi regulatory hearings, quantum breakthrough announcements, grid-storage IRA deadlines)?
- What's the optimal "event-aware" horizon formula: `base_horizon × (1 - event_proximity_weight × days_to_event / lookback_window)`?

**3.2 Volatility-Regime Label Adaptation**
- In low-vol regimes (VIX <15), should barriers widen to ±6-8% to avoid overtrading chop?
- In high-vol regimes (VIX >30), should barriers tighten to ±2-3% to catch fast moves before reversals?
- Should barrier asymmetry shift by regime? (Bull+low-vol: +6%/-4%? Bear+high-vol: +3%/-5%?)

**3.3 Sector-Specific Label Calibration**
- Do frontier sectors have different "natural move sizes"?
  - Quantum (IONQ, RGTI): ±8-12% per week?
  - AI infra (NVDA, AMD): ±3-5% per week?
  - Robotaxis (TSLA, UBER): ±4-7% per week?
  - Grid storage (STEM, ENS): ±6-10% per week?
- Should we train separate label generators per sector, then ensemble predictions?

**3.4 Forward-Return Distribution Mining**
- What does the true forward-return distribution look like for each sector/regime?
- Are there "fat tails" (>3σ moves) that occur >5% of the time, suggesting barriers should extend further?
- Do forward returns cluster around specific values (e.g., TSLA often moves in ±7% chunks, not gradual)?

### What We Want:
1. An adaptive horizon formula that compresses/expands based on event proximity, vol regime, and sector dynamics.
2. Sector-specific barrier calibrations based on empirical forward-return distributions (not theoretical assumptions).
3. Validation framework: label stability >75%, forward-return match rate >70%, per-sector confusion matrices showing BUY/SELL labels actually predict directional moves.

## 💡 DISCOVERY LAYER 4: Feature Archaeology (What Others Miss)

### The Questions Nobody Asks:

**4.1 Cross-Asset Sentiment Bleeding**
- Does Bitcoin price action predict MSTR, COIN, and then bleed into broader tech (NVDA, AMD) 24-48hrs later?
- Do Treasury yields (10Y, 2Y) predict sector rotation OUT of high-growth (quantum, robotaxis) INTO defensives, with 1-3 day lag?
- Does crude oil vol predict energy-transition names (FLNC, ENS, STEM) via some hidden channel?

**4.2 Intraday Microstructure Features**
- First 30min vs last 30min: does the price action in opening/closing auctions predict next-day continuation?
- Do names that gap-up on volume but close near lows of day reverse within 2-3 days (failed breakout signature)?
- What role does "inside bar" vs "outside bar" structure play in 5-15d forecasting for frontier names?

**4.3 Options Greeks as Forward-Looking Predictors**
- Does gamma exposure (GEX) predict intraday vs multi-day mean-reversion behavior?
- Do names with call skew >60th percentile outperform over next 10 days, or is it already priced?
- Can we use put/call ratio + skew + term-structure as a composite "smart money positioning" score?

**4.4 Hidden Momentum Signatures**
- Instead of simple RSI(14), what about:
  - RSI slope (is momentum accelerating or decelerating)?
  - RSI divergence (price makes new high, RSI doesn't → bearish)?
  - Multi-timeframe RSI (5min, 1hr, daily) alignment score?
- Do "swing extent" features (today's high-low / ATR) predict continuation vs exhaustion?
- What about "breakout volume confirmation": volume on breakout day >2× 20-day avg → 70%+ follow-through probability?

**4.5 Anchored VWAP + Order Flow Composite**
- Combine: distance from AVWAP + bid-ask spread + block trade frequency → composite "institutional positioning" score.
- Does this composite predict 3-5 day moves better than any single feature?
- Can we detect "silent accumulation" (AVWAP flat, but blocks keep printing) vs "loud distribution" (AVWAP rising, but spreads widening)?

**4.6 Breadth & Participation Metrics**
- Sector-level: % of names above 20-day SMA, % making 5-day highs, % with positive 3-day momentum.
- Do breadth thrusts (>70% of sector above SMA) predict 10-15 day continuation?
- Do breadth divergences (index up, breadth down) predict 5-10 day reversals?

### What We Want:
1. A ranked list of 40-60 features for 5-15d frontier-sector forecasting, with empirical predictive power (mutual information, SHAP values, Boruta feature importance).
2. Cross-asset sentiment features that front-run sector moves by 24-72hrs.
3. Composite scores that combine microstructure + options + AVWAP + breadth for multi-dimensional signal confirmation.
4. Feature interaction effects: which features work ONLY in specific regimes? (Example: RSI divergence might only matter in high-vol regimes.)

## 📰 DISCOVERY LAYER 5: News, Context & Information Flow Edges

### The Questions Nobody Asks:

**5.1 Pre-Announcement Footprints**
- What unusual patterns appear 1-3 days BEFORE major news breaks?
  - Options activity (unusual call/put flow)?
  - Dark pool blocks?
  - Social media chatter (Twitter/StockTwits mentions spiking)?
  - Insider transaction filings (Form 4s)?
- Can we build a "pre-catalyst detector" that flags names 24-48hrs before announcements?

**5.2 News Diffusion Timing**
- How long does it take for news to propagate?
  - Tier 1 news (Bloomberg, Reuters): instant → priced in <5min?
  - Tier 2 news (Seeking Alpha, Benzinga): 15-30min lag?
  - Tier 3 news (Reddit, Twitter): 1-2hr lag but sometimes leads?
- Which news sources have predictive alpha for frontier sectors? (Example: Does a specific quantum researcher's Twitter thread predict IONQ moves 6-12hrs later?)

**5.3 Sentiment Quantification Beyond Headlines**
- Can we score sentiment intensity: "breakthrough" vs "progress" vs "setback" vs "regulatory concern"?
- What about sentiment momentum: is the narrative accelerating (more positive articles per day) or fading?
- Cross-sector sentiment bleed: does negative AI regulation news predict quantum/robotaxi weakness 1-2 days later?

**5.4 Event Calendar as Feature**
- Build a forward-looking event calendar: earnings dates, FDA decisions, regulatory hearings, product launches, conference presentations.
- Does event density (number of upcoming catalysts in next 30 days) predict vol expansion and directional bias?
- Can we weight predictions lower when major events are <5 days away (too much uncertainty)?

**5.5 Supply Chain News Mining**
- Does news about ASML tool orders predict NVDA/AMD moves 2-4 weeks later?
- Does shipping data (port congestion, freight rates) predict inventory builds/drawdowns for TSLA, robotaxis?
- Do natural gas prices + weather patterns predict grid-storage demand (STEM, ENS, FLNC)?

### What We Want:
1. A lightweight news-scoring pipeline that captures: sentiment, source tier, recency, and cross-sector bleed effects.
2. Pre-catalyst detection signatures: options + dark pool + social chatter that flag moves 24-48hrs early.
3. Event-calendar integration: compress horizons and lower conviction when major catalysts loom.
4. Chatbot integration: surface news scores with source tags, recency stamps, and confidence bounds to avoid hallucination/overreaction.

## 🔍 DISCOVERY LAYER 6: Training Strategy Archaeology

### The Questions Nobody Asks:

**6.1 Regime-Shift Temporal Weighting**
- Instead of simple time-decay, can we identify regime breakpoints (post-2023 AI capex boom, 2024 robotaxi regulatory shifts, 2025 quantum hardware breakthroughs) and upweight samples post-breakpoint by 3-5×?
- How do we detect breakpoints automatically? (Vol structure changes, correlation matrix shifts, factor rotation, narrative density spikes?)
- Should we train separate models pre/post each breakpoint, then ensemble with recency weights?

**6.2 Sample Importance by Regime Rarity**
- Rare regimes (vol-crush, flash crashes, regulatory shocks) might be underrepresented.
- Should we OVERSAMPLE rare regimes (even though they're old) to ensure the model knows how to handle them?
- What's the trade-off: recent data (more relevant) vs rare regimes (more informative for tail risk)?

**6.3 Cross-Validation That Respects Causality**
- Standard time-series CV: train on [t-N:t], test on [t:t+M]. But what if regime shifts mid-window?
- Can we build "regime-aware CV" that only validates on samples from the same regime as training?
- What about "forward-simulation CV": train on historical data, but validate using monte-carlo paths that mimic current regime dynamics?

**6.4 Adaptive Learning Rates by Regime**
- Should model updates (online learning, daily retraining) use higher learning rates when regime is stable, lower when regime is shifting?
- Can we detect regime stability in real-time (correlation structure, vol term-structure, breadth trends) and adjust learning rates accordingly?

**6.5 Meta-Learning Across Sectors**
- Can we train a "meta-model" that learns how to learn from new sectors?
- Example: pre-train on AI infra (NVDA, AMD), then fine-tune on quantum (IONQ, RGTI) using transfer learning?
- Does meta-learning improve sample efficiency for frontier sectors with limited history?

### What We Want:
1. A breakpoint-detection method that identifies regime shifts automatically and applies recency weights post-shift.
2. Regime-aware CV strategy that validates only on in-regime samples to avoid leakage.
3. Sample importance weighting that balances recency (2023-2025) vs rarity (vol-crush, regulatory shocks).
4. Online learning strategy with adaptive learning rates based on real-time regime stability metrics.
5. Transfer learning / meta-learning approach to bootstrap new frontier sectors (quantum, grid storage) from established sectors (AI infra).

## 📊 DISCOVERY LAYER 7: Evaluation Beyond Accuracy (Economic Value Proof)

### The Questions Nobody Asks:

**7.1 Per-Sector Economic Value**
- Global accuracy means nothing. What's the per-sector Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio?
- Which sectors generate alpha (>0.5 Sharpe) and which destroy value?
- Should we dynamically allocate capital: 50% to high-Sharpe sectors, 30% to medium, 20% to low (with tight stops)?

**7.2 Regime-Conditioned Win Rates**
- What's the win-rate in each micro-regime (bull+low-vol, bear+high-vol, chop+expanding-breadth, etc.)?
- Are there regimes where we should skip trading entirely (e.g., vol-crush + negative breadth → 35% win-rate → don't trade)?
- Can we build a "trade filter" that only trades regimes with >55% historical win-rate?

**7.3 Drawdown Archaeology**
- When do drawdowns occur? Regime transitions? Sector rotations? News shocks?
- Can we detect drawdowns EARLY (within 2-3 trades) and halt trading until regime stabilizes?
- What's the optimal "circuit breaker": pause after 3 consecutive losses? After 5% drawdown in 5 days?

**7.4 Prediction Confidence Calibration**
- If model says "70% confidence BUY," does it actually win 70% of the time?
- If model confidence is poorly calibrated, how do we fix it? (Platt scaling, isotonic regression, beta calibration?)
- Can we build a "meta-confidence" model that predicts: "this 70% prediction is actually 55%" based on regime/sector/microstructure context?

**7.5 Selective Prediction Thresholds**
- What confidence threshold maximizes Sharpe ratio? (Maybe 60% confidence trades are still profitable?)
- What's the trade-off: more trades (lower threshold) vs higher win-rate (higher threshold)?
- Should thresholds vary by sector? (Quantum: require 75%+ confidence due to high vol. AI infra: 60%+ OK due to clearer trends.)

**7.6 Tail Risk & Black Swan Preparedness**
- How often do >3σ moves occur, and does the model predict them or get blindsided?
- Can we build a "tail risk detector" using: vol spikes, breadth collapse, dark pool exodus, options panic selling?
- What's the optimal position sizing when tail risk detector fires? (Cut size by 50%? Hedge with VIX calls?)

**7.7 Implementation Realism**
- What's the impact of:
  - Slippage (assume 0.05-0.1% per trade)?
  - Commission (assume $1-5 per trade)?
  - Opportunity cost (capital locked for 5-15 days)?
- After realistic costs, what's the true expected annual return per sector?

### What We Want:
1. Per-sector, per-regime performance dashboards showing: Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, max drawdown, win-rate, avg win/loss.
2. Trade filters that skip regimes with <55% historical win-rate.
3. Confidence calibration curves and meta-confidence models that adjust raw predictions.
4. Selective prediction thresholds per sector that maximize Sharpe ratio after costs.
5. Tail risk detection system with position sizing rules and hedge triggers.
6. Post-cost, post-slippage economic value projections to prove this isn't just curve-fitting.

## 💰 DISCOVERY LAYER 9: FREE DATA SUBSTITUTION STRATEGY

### CRITICAL: We Don't Have Premium API Access Yet

**Reality Check**: We cannot afford paid data subscriptions for:
- Dark pool feeds (Cheddar Flow, DIX, FINRA ADF data)
- Professional options flow platforms (SpotGamma, Volland, Trade Alert)
- Advanced order flow (Level 2 tape, time & sales at microsecond resolution)
- Institutional sentiment feeds (Goldman Sachs sentiment, JPM flow data)

**BUT** - we believe 70-80% of these signals can be approximated using free data + clever analysis.

### The Questions We MUST Ask:

**9.1 Dark Pool Proxies Using Free Data**
- **Question**: If we can't access dark pool feeds directly, what FREE proxies correlate >0.6 with dark pool accumulation?
  - Can we detect **volume anomalies** in yfinance minute-bar data? (Example: 5-10 consecutive bars with volume >2σ but price only moves 0.1-0.3% = potential dark pool absorption?)
  - Can we identify **large block trades** from free intraday data by detecting: single bars with volume >3× average bar volume?
  - Does **after-hours volume clustering** (last 30min + pre-market 30min) predict institutional positioning without needing dark pool data?
  - What about **VWAP anchoring behavior**: if price keeps touching VWAP but doesn't break through for 10+ bars, does this suggest hidden liquidity (proxy for dark pool support)?

**9.2 Options Flow Approximation from Free Yahoo Finance Options Data**
- **Question**: Yahoo Finance provides free options chains (OI, volume, IV). How can we extract 80% of "smart money" signals without paid platforms?
  - **Unusual OI build**: Compare today's call/put OI vs 5-day average. If call OI spikes >2σ at specific strike, is this a proxy for institutional accumulation?
  - **Skew shifts from free IV data**: Calculate `put_IV(ATM) / call_IV(ATM)` ratio. If this drops from 1.05 → 0.92 over 3 days, does this predict bullish catalyst?
  - **Volume-to-OI ratio**: If call volume today is 3× yesterday's OI, someone opened massive new positions. Can we detect this 24-48hrs before breakouts?
  - **Strike clustering analysis**: If 70% of call OI clusters at one strike (e.g., IONQ $15 calls), does this create a "gamma magnet" effect that free data can identify?

**9.3 Order Flow Proxies from Minute-Bar Microstructure**
- **Question**: Without Level 2 data, what minute-bar patterns from yfinance predict institutional accumulation?
  - **Bid-ask spread compression proxy**: Calculate `(high - low) / close` for each minute bar. If this ratio decreases from 0.8% → 0.3% over 30 bars, is the spread tightening (accumulation signal)?
  - **Sequential bar direction analysis**: If 15 out of 20 consecutive minute bars close higher than they opened (green candles) but total price move is only +1.2%, is this "controlled accumulation"?
  - **Intraday momentum persistence**: Does `(close_3pm - open_930am) / (high_11am - open_930am)` predict next-day continuation? (If price sustains gains all day, institutions aren't selling into strength.)
  - **Failed breakdown recovery speed**: If price drops -2% in 10 minutes then recovers +1.5% in next 30 minutes, is this a "liquidity test" followed by buying (institutional fingerprint)?

**9.4 Supply Chain Lead Indicators from Free SEC Filings + Public Data**
- **Question**: Without Bloomberg Terminal access, how do we track supply chain leads using only free sources?
  - **SEC Form 4 insider trading**: SEC EDGAR is free. Can we scrape ASML/LRCX insider buys and use them to predict NVDA moves 3-5 weeks later?
  - **Earnings call transcripts (free from Seeking Alpha/company IR)**: Can we parse for keywords like "order acceleration," "capacity expansion," "extended lead times" that predict supplier → leader momentum?
  - **Patent filings (free from USPTO)**: Do quantum computing patent filing clusters predict IONQ/RGTI breakouts 2-4 months later?
  - **Job postings (free from LinkedIn, Indeed)**: If ASML posts 50+ new "EUV technician" jobs in one month, does this predict capex boom → NVDA rally?

**9.5 Sentiment & News Flow from Free Sources**
- **Question**: Without Bloomberg/Reuters subscriptions, what free sentiment sources have predictive power?
  - **Reddit WallStreetBets / StockTwits mention volume**: Does a 3σ spike in mentions predict moves 6-24hrs later for frontier names?
  - **Google Trends search volume**: Does "IONQ stock" search volume predict retail FOMO 1-2 days before breakout?
  - **Earnings transcript sentiment (free from Seeking Alpha)**: Can we score CEO tone (bullish vs cautious language) and predict post-earnings drift?
  - **Twitter/X aerospace & quantum researcher activity**: Do key influencers in quantum computing tweet before catalyst announcements? Can we track their activity as pre-catalyst signal?

**9.6 Cross-Asset Correlation Leads from Free Crypto/Macro Data**
- **Question**: Which free macro/crypto data sources predict frontier-sector moves 24-72hrs early?
  - **Bitcoin price from free APIs (CoinGecko, CryptoCompare)**: Does BTC daily return >+5% predict MSTR spike same day → NVDA/AMD spike next day → IONQ spike day 3-5?
  - **Treasury yield changes (free from FRED)**: Does 10Y yield spike >+15bps in one day predict sector rotation OUT of quantum/robotaxi INTO defensives 2-3 days later?
  - **VIX term structure (free from CBOE)**: Does VIX contango → backwardation flip predict regime shift 24-48hrs before it shows in breadth/momentum?
  - **Crude oil volatility (free from yfinance)**: Does oil vol expansion predict energy-transition names (STEM, ENS) weakness 1-2 days later?

**9.7 Breadth & Participation from Free yfinance Data**
- **Question**: We can download ALL sector tickers for free. What breadth metrics predict rotation/regime shifts?
  - **% of tickers above 20-day SMA**: If AI sector breadth drops from 85% → 55% in 3 days while quantum rises 40% → 65%, is rotation confirmed?
  - **New highs vs new lows ratio**: If AI infra new highs drop from 12 → 3 while new lows rise 2 → 8, is peak near?
  - **Equal-weight vs cap-weight divergence**: Calculate equal-weight sector returns vs NVIDIA-heavy cap-weight. Does 3-day divergence >2% predict exhaustion?
  - **Advance-decline line**: If NVDA makes new high but only 40% of AI sector makes new high, is this bearish divergence worth -200 to -400 bps over next 5 days?

**9.8 Regime Detection Without Paid Volatility Data**
- **Question**: Can we build a 12-regime classifier using only VIX + free breadth + free ATR calculations?
  - **VIX regimes**: <15, 15-25, 25-35, >35 (free from CBOE).
  - **Breadth state**: Calculate from yfinance sector data (expanding/contracting/diverging).
  - **Vol term-structure proxy**: Use ATR(14) / ATR(50) ratio as "realized vol regime" indicator. If >1.2 = high vol, <0.8 = low vol.
  - **Sector heat**: Calculate % of sector making 5-day highs. >60% = hot, <30% = cold.
  - **Combine into 12 regimes**: [VIX regime] × [breadth state] × [sector heat]. Does this free approach match 80%+ of paid regime classifiers?

**9.9 Pre-Catalyst Detection Without Dark Pool/Advanced Options**
- **Question**: Using ONLY free yfinance options + volume data, can we detect catalysts 24-48hrs early?
  - **Options OI acceleration**: If call OI at 30 DTE grows >50% in 2 days, does catalyst follow within 4-8 weeks?
  - **Volume spikes on no news**: If volume is 200%+ of 20-day average but no press releases, is this insider accumulation before announcement?
  - **After-hours price action**: If stock moves +2% after-hours on low volume (institutional hours), does this predict news within 24-48hrs?
  - **Analyst rating cluster timing**: Free from Finviz. If 3+ analysts upgrade within 5 days, does this predict continued momentum for 10-15 days?

**9.10 Adaptive Horizons & Event Calendars from Free Sources**
- **Question**: How do we build event-aware horizon compression without Bloomberg Terminal?
  - **Earnings dates**: Free from Yahoo Finance, yfinance library, Seeking Alpha.
  - **Fed announcement calendar**: Free from federalreserve.gov.
  - **Product launch rumors**: Track Twitter, Reddit, company IR pages.
  - **Regulatory calendar**: Free from SEC.gov (quantum/robotaxi regulatory hearings).
  - **Economic calendar**: Free from FRED, Investing.com.
  - **Implementation**: Compress forecast horizon from 10d → 5d when earnings <7 days away. Does this improve accuracy by avoiding event uncertainty?

### What We Want from Perplexity:

**For EACH paid data type we can't afford, give us:**

1. **3-5 free data proxies** that correlate >0.5-0.7 with the paid signal
2. **Exact calculation formulas** using yfinance, pandas, FRED, free APIs
3. **Empirical correlation studies**: "Free proxy X predicts paid signal Y with 0.68 correlation, 2-day lag"
4. **Win-rate validation**: "Free volume anomaly method detects dark pool accumulation with 62% accuracy vs 73% for paid feed"
5. **False positive rates**: "Free method triggers 15-20 signals/month, 60% true positives. Paid method: 12 signals/month, 75% true positives. Trade-off acceptable?"

### Success Criteria:

- **70-80% of paid signal predictive power** using free proxies
- **Proof of concept**: Run free method on 2024 data, show it would have caught IONQ breakout 7 days early, NVDA supply chain signal 21 days early
- **Clear upgrade path**: "Free method gives 58% accuracy. Adding $50/month dark pool feed would boost to 68%. Adding $200/month options flow would boost to 73%. ROI justified after first profitable month."

## 🔥 FINAL CHALLENGE TO PERPLEXITY

**We don't want textbook answers. We want:**
- Names nobody is talking about yet (the next IONQ before it 10x'd).
- Patterns that only become visible when you look at order flow + options + breadth + news together.
- Regime structures that 99% of retail (and 80% of institutions) miss.
- Feature combinations that have never been published in academic papers.
- Training strategies that adapt in real-time as regimes shifts.
- Evaluation metrics that prove economic value, not just statistical significance.

**AND NOW MOST CRITICALLY:**
- **Free data substitutes** for every paid signal we've asked about.
- **Exact proxy formulas** we can implement TODAY in Colab using yfinance + pandas.
- **Correlation studies** proving free proxies capture 60-80% of paid signal alpha.
- **Clear ROI math** showing when paid upgrades become justified ($50/month dark pool feed = +10% accuracy = +$X/month = ROI positive after Y trades).

**Turn over every stone. Find what's hidden in plain sight. Give us the map to navigate the next 12-24 months in frontier sectors - starting with $0 data budget.**
