# 🤖 Perplexity Funding Request - Community Intervention Strategy

## 🎯 **THE NEXT QUESTION YOU'LL BE ASKED BY PERPLEXITY**

### **Primary Question for Perplexity:**
> "I've built a comprehensive AI trading system with 50+ institutional-grade modules covering elite trading engines, advanced scanners, institutional dashboards, quant algorithms, data orchestrators, and AI recommendenders. The system achieves 70-80% win rates with professional risk management and modern async architecture. I have all the code organized and ready, but I realize I need community intervention to take this to the next level. What's the best strategy to:

1. **Secure funding** for development and deployment
2. **Get community help** to build and refine the system
3. **Structure this as a collaborative project** that benefits everyone
4. **Position this for maximum impact** in the quant trading community

I have 200+ additional modules in the E drive that I can contribute, but I need guidance on the best approach to build this as a community-driven project that can attract both developers and funding."
