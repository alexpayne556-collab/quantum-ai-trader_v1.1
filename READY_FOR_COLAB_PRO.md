## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Training
- [ ] Ensure Colab Pro subscription active
- [ ] Select T4 or A100 GPU runtime
- [ ] Check GPU availability: `torch.cuda.is_available()`
- [ ] Verify all bundle files uploaded

### During Training
- [ ] Monitor GPU memory usage
- [ ] Watch for convergence (loss decreasing)
- [ ] Check accuracy improvements
- [ ] Note any errors or warnings

### After Training
- [ ] Download ALL 4 model files
- [ ] Verify file sizes (CNN ~11MB, numerical ~2MB)
- [ ] Save training logs and metrics
- [ ] Backup models before integration

### Integration
- [ ] Test models on historical data first
- [ ] Compare v2.0 vs v1.1 performance
- [ ] Run paper trading for 1 week minimum
- [ ] Monitor win rate, avg return, drawdown
- [ ] Only deploy if v2.0 > v1.1 + 5% accuracy

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Colab Pro
- **Monthly:** $9.99/month
- **Per Training Run:** ~$0.50 in compute units
- **Total Cost:** <$1 for initial training

### Worth It?
If v2.0 improves avg return by +0.68% per trade:
- 100 trades = +$68 on $10k account
- 500 trades = +$340 on $10k account
- **ROI:** 34x on training cost 🚀
