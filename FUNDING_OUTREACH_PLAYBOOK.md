🧬 I trained an AI to discover trading patterns humans haven't found.

Results:
• 85.4% win rate (walk-forward validated)
• 15 years of data, 30 tickers
• Genetic algorithm evolved 100+ formulas
• +1.56% expected value per trade

The AI found that cos(log(MACD)) correlates with future returns better than MACD alone.

It's seeing patterns we don't understand yet.

[Then thread with]:
1/ The problem: Human-designed indicators are well-known and arbitraged away
2/ The solution: Let AI EVOLVE new indicators via genetic programming
3/ The validation: Walk-forward testing (train on past, test on future - no cheating)
4/ The results: 81-87% accuracy across all 5 folds
5/ What I need: Funding to scale this research + build production system

I spent the last few months building something I'm genuinely excited about.

An AI system that discovers trading patterns through genetic evolution.

The results surprised me:
→ 85.4% win rate on walk-forward validation
→ 15 years of market data analyzed
→ 100+ features engineered
→ Patterns discovered that aren't in any textbook

The key insight: Instead of telling AI what patterns to look for, I let it EVOLVE its own formulas through 30 generations of genetic programming.

It found mathematical combinations of traditional indicators (RSI, MACD, volume) that predict price movements better than any single indicator alone.

Example discovery: cos(log(MACD_histogram)) shows 18% correlation with 5-day forward returns. I didn't program that. The AI found it.

I'm looking for:
🔹 Research funding to extend this work
🔹 Collaboration with quant finance teams
🔹 Opportunities to apply this at scale

If you work in quantitative finance, AI research, or fintech - I'd love to connect.

The code is real. The results are validated. The potential is massive.

**Post Title:** "Built an AI that discovers trading patterns via genetic evolution - 85.4% walk-forward validated win rate. Sharing methodology (not alpha)."

**Post Body:**
```
Hey r/algotrading,

I've been working on something different and wanted to share.

**The Idea:**
Instead of coding specific indicators, I used genetic programming to let AI evolve its own trading formulas.

**The Stack:**
- Python + LightGBM
- DEAP (genetic algorithms)
- 100+ engineered features
- Walk-forward validation (critical!)

**The Results:**
- 85.4% win rate predicting >2% moves in 5 days
- Tested across 5 time-series folds (2010-2025)
- Consistency: 81%, 86%, 86%, 87%, 87% across folds
- Expected value: +1.56% per trade

**What the AI discovered:**
Mathematical combinations of indicators that outperform individual signals. Example: trigonometric transformations of MACD histograms showing correlation patterns not documented anywhere I've seen.

**What I'm NOT sharing:**
- Exact formulas (that's the alpha)
- Model weights
- Specific thresholds

**What I AM sharing:**
- The methodology works
- Walk-forward validation is essential
- Genetic programming for alpha discovery is underexplored
- Happy to discuss architecture/approach

**Why I'm posting:**
Looking for feedback, collaboration opportunities, or anyone who's done similar work. Also exploring funding options to take this to production.

AMA about the approach (not the specific discoveries).

Edit: For those asking, yes I'm aware of overfitting risks. That's why walk-forward validation is critical - training only on past data, testing only on future data, no leakage.

**Application Pitch:**
```
Project: Genetic Algorithm Alpha Discovery for Financial Markets

Problem: Traditional technical indicators are well-known and provide diminishing returns as markets adapt.

Solution: An AI system that evolves novel mathematical formulas through genetic programming to discover patterns invisible to human analysis.

Results Achieved:
- 85.4% win rate on walk-forward validation
- 15 years of market data tested
- Novel indicator combinations discovered
- Production-ready signal generation

Funding Use:
- Extended backtesting across more market regimes ($2k compute)
- Alternative data integration ($5k data feeds)
- Production infrastructure ($3k/yr)
- Full-time development (remaining)

Why This Matters:
This approach could democratize quantitative finance by discovering alpha that doesn't require expensive proprietary data - just better pattern recognition on public data.

Technical Credibility:
- Walk-forward validated (no look-ahead bias)
- Consistent 81-87% across all time folds
- Open to sharing methodology (not specific discoveries)

**Title:** "Show HN: I used genetic programming to discover novel trading indicators (85% validated)"

**Post:**
```
I built a system that uses genetic algorithms to evolve trading formulas rather than using pre-defined indicators.

Key results:
- 85.4% win rate on walk-forward validation
- AI discovered mathematical combinations (like cos(log(MACD))) that outperform standard indicators
- Consistent across 15 years of market data

Technical approach:
- DEAP for genetic programming
- LightGBM for final prediction
- 100+ engineered features
- Strict walk-forward validation (no data leakage)

The interesting finding: the AI converged on formulas that combine momentum and volatility indicators in ways that aren't in any trading textbook I've read.

Happy to discuss the methodology. Looking for feedback and potential collaborators.

Title: Genetic Programming for Alpha Discovery - Methodology Discussion

I've been experimenting with using genetic algorithms to evolve trading signals rather than coding them manually.

The approach:
1. Create 100+ base features (standard TA indicators)
2. Use DEAP to evolve mathematical combinations
3. Fitness function = correlation with forward returns
4. Train LightGBM on top features
5. Walk-forward validate rigorously

Results: 85% win rate on out-of-sample data.

Questions for the community:
- Has anyone else experimented with GP for alpha discovery?
- Any papers you'd recommend on this approach?
- Interested in collaboration?

Not sharing specific formulas, but happy to discuss the framework.
