## 🎯 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT (4-Week Plan)

### Week 0: Tomorrow (Perplexity Research)
**Goal**: Get architectural decisions from Perplexity

```
Morning (2-3 hours):
- Ask 25 final Perplexity questions on forecaster architecture
- Get answers on: meta-learner design, feature selection, integration, training
- Document all answers

Afternoon (1 hour):
- Create PERPLEXITY_FORECASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Map answers to Week 1 implementation tasks
- Confirm readiness for development

Expected output:

Total: $0/month ($0/year)

Savings: $550/month = $6,600/year
```

### Performance Case
```
Current system (pattern + regime):
- Win-rate: 34%
- Avg win: +8%
- Avg loss: -3%
- Position size: 1%
- Annual return: 34% × 8% - 66% × 3% = 2.72% - 1.98% = 0.74%
- Sharpe: 0.3

Integrated system (with research):
- Win-rate: 60%
- Avg win: +7% (similar, maybe slightly less)
- Avg loss: -2.5% (tighter stops from better timing)
- Position size: 2.5% (confident sizing)
- Annual return: 60% × 7% - 40% × 2.5% = 4.2% - 1% = 3.2%
- Sharpe: 0.6

Improvement: +258% annual return (0.74% → 3.2%)
Plus: $6,600/year savings from free data
Total economic value: 3.25% annual + $6,600/year
