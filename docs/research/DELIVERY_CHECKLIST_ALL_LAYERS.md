## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will this work with my existing regime recommender?**  
A: YES. The research features are separate from ADX-based regime. You can combine them (ensemble approach: 50% ADX regime, 50% 12-regime from research).

**Q: Is all data really FREE?**  
A: YES. All sources are 100% free tier (yfinance, Yahoo Finance options, SEC EDGAR, FRED, CoinGecko, Google Trends, Reddit PRAW).

**Q: What's the expected accuracy?**  
A: 55-60% on 5-15d horizon (vs your current 34%). With paid dark pool feed later ($50/mo), could reach 65-72%.

**Q: Can I use this with my existing 50-ticker system?**  
A: YES. Either: (1) Augment current (add research features), or (2) Fork into two systems (50 old + 100 new).

**Q: How much time to implement?**  
A: 15-18 hours total over 3 weeks. Most is running Colab cells + reading.

**Q: Can this run on my laptop?**  
A: YES (all free Colab GPU). Or AWS Lambda for daily scheduled runs (~$1-5/month).
